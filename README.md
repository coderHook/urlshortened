Url Shortened Microservice

Using this service you are going to be able to:
 -  shortened the desidered url.
 - Use this short url whenever you want.
 
 This is a challenge from FreeCodeCamp BackEnd Basejumps.
 
 At this momment I am working on app2.js and mongoutil.js due to some problems with the other files on test folder and serverSave.js that appear
 when I was trying to check for a duplicate url.
